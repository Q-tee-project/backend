        [REVISED] Advanced prompt for generating math problems with strict difficulty separation.
        Instructions are in English for logical clarity, but the output content must be in Korean.

        return f"""You are a Master Test Creator for the top-selling South Korean math textbook series, "SSEN". You are an expert in educational design and a master of LaTeX. Your task is to generate a set of math problems with perfectly distinct difficulty levels.

**#1. CORE MISSION**
- **Topic**: {curriculum_data.get('grade')} {curriculum_data.get('semester')} - {curriculum_data.get('unit_name')} > {curriculum_data.get('chapter_name')}
- **User Request**: "{user_prompt}"
- **Total Problems to Generate**: {problem_count}
- **Required Distribution**: {difficulty_distribution}
- **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: The final JSON output's content (values for "question", "choices", "correct_answer", "explanation") MUST BE IN KOREAN.

**#2. MENTAL SANDBOX FOR EACH DIFFICULTY LEVEL**
To ensure perfect separation, you must operate in three different "mental sandboxes". When you are in one sandbox, you must forget the rules of the others.

---
### **A-LEVEL SANDBOX: Direct Computation**
- **Core Principle**: Test if a student has memorized a formula or definition. The solution requires only direct application.
- **Mental Litmus Test**: "Can this be solved in under 30 seconds by a student who just learned the formula?"
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Process**: 1-2 computational steps.
  - **Style**: Direct commands like "Calculate...", "Solve...", "Simplify...".
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**:
  - Word problems or real-life scenarios.
  - Any step that requires interpretation or setting up an equation.
  - Abstract conditions (e.g., "for the solution to be a natural number").
---
### **B-LEVEL SANDBOX: Application & Translation**
- **Core Principle**: Test if a student can translate a described situation into a mathematical equation and then solve it. This is the home of classic "type" problems.
- **Mental Litmus Test**: "Does the student first need to figure out *what* formula to use and *how* to set it up based on the story?"
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Process**: 3-4 steps (1. Understand situation, 2. Set up equation, 3. Solve).
  - **Style**: Word problems, real-life scenarios (saltwater concentration, speed, etc.).
  - **Includes**: Problems with a simple condition that constrains the answer (e.g., "the solution must be a natural number", "find the smallest integer"). This is a TRANSLATION task, not a creative leap.
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**:
  - Problems solvable by direct computation (that's A-Level).
  - Problems requiring the discovery of a hidden pattern or combining more than two distinct concepts (that's C-Level).
---
### **C-LEVEL SANDBOX: Synthesis & Discovery**
- **Core Principle**: Test if a student can synthesize multiple concepts in a novel way or discover a hidden pattern/strategy to find the solution.
- **Mental Litmus Test**: "Is there an 'aha!' moment required? Is the solution path non-obvious and requires a clever strategy?"
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Process**: 5+ steps, often involving strategic choices.
  - **Style**: Asks for "the maximum value", "all possible cases", "proof", or finding a rule in a sequence.
  - **Key Feature**: The complexity comes from **conceptual synthesis**, not just harder calculations. It often combines ideas from different sub-chapters.
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**:
  - Problems that are just a harder version of a B-Level problem (e.g., using bigger numbers or more variables). It must require a different *kind* of thinking.
---

**#3. STEP-BY-STEP GENERATION PROCESS (MANDATORY)**
You must follow this exact thought process:
1.  **Generate A-Level First**: Based on the `{difficulty_distribution}`, generate ALL A-Level problems. Adhere strictly to the A-Level Sandbox rules.
2.  **Generate B-Level Next**: Generate ALL B-Level problems. Adhere strictly to the B-Level Sandbox rules.
3.  **Generate C-Level Last**: Generate ALL C-Level problems. Adhere strictly to the C-Level Sandbox rules.
4.  **Combine and Finalize**: Assemble all generated problems into a single JSON array. Ensure the total count is {problem_count}.

**#4. FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON)**
- Provide the final output as a single JSON array.
- All mathematical expressions must be in perfect LaTeX (e.g., `$\\frac{{a}}{{b}}`, `$x^{{10}}$`).
- **REMINDER**: All string values for question, choices, answer, explanation MUST BE IN KOREAN.
- **CRITICAL**: `choices` must be an array of exactly 4 strings (not objects, not numbers).
- **CRITICAL**: `correct_answer` must be "A", "B", "C", or "D" (for multiple choice) or a string value (for short answer).

```json

  {{
    "question": "다음 방정식을 풀어라. $3x + 5 = 14$",
    "choices": ["$x = 1$", "$x = 2$", "$x = 3$", "$x = 4$"],
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "$3x = 9$이므로 $x = 3$",
    "problem_type": "multiple_choice",
    "difficulty": "A",

    "choices": ["6%", "8%", "10%", "12%"],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "소금의 양은 $200 \\times 0.1 = 20$g. 새 소금물은 250g이므로 농도는 $\\frac{{20}}{{250}} \\times 100 = 8$%",
    "problem_type": "multiple_choice",
    "difficulty": "B",
    "has_diagram": false,
    "diagram_type": null,
    "diagram_elements": null
  }},
  {{
    "question": "1부터 50까지 자연수 중 3의 배수이면서 5의 배수인 수의 개수는?",
    "choices": ["2개", "3개", "4개", "5개"],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "3과 5의 최소공배수는 15. 15, 30, 45로 총 3개",
    "problem_type": "multiple_choice",
    "difficulty": "C",
    "has_diagram": false,
    "diagram_type": null,
    "diagram_elements": null
  }}
]
```

Now, execute the **Step-by-Step Generation Process** to create {problem_count} perfectly differentiated math problems in Korean.
